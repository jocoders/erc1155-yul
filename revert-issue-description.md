# Issue with validateERC1155BatchRecipient Function

### Problem Description
The `validateERC1155BatchRecipient` function consistently reverts without providing a specific error message, making it difficult to diagnose the issue.

### Steps Taken
- **Fallback Function Test:** Implemented and tested the `fallback` function on the receiving contract to see if it gets triggered, indicating a successful function call. It did not execute, suggesting the call may not be occurring.
- **Parameter Verification:** Logged and checked the encoded parameters against the expected inputs, confirming they match exactly.
- **Data Decoding Attempts:** Tried decoding the `bytes` data with various configurations and adjusted the call length parameter, but these changes did not resolve the issue.
- **Log Analysis:** Reviewed the logs, which confirmed that data encoding from the selector to the end of the bytes data is accurate.

### Input Arguments and Encoding Logs
Here are the details of the input arguments and the corresponding logs for two scenarios:

**0xbc197c81 =  bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))**

#### Scenario 1: With 0 offsets for bytes data
**Input Arguments:**
- IDs: `[77, 88, 99]`

### Conclusion
The function selector matches the expected value, and the arguments are correctly passed and encoded according to the logs. \
The `argSize` is also verified to be correct as it matches the calculated size in the logs. \
Despite these verifications, the `fallback` function does not get triggered, indicating that no call is made to the other contract at all. \
Additionally, the logs do not show any return data from the `call` operation, only returning `false`. \
This suggests that the issue might be with the contract call itself, not triggering as expected, and not providing any error data 
to diagnose the problem further. \
I request your assistance in reviewing this situation to help identify and resolve the underlying issue.
